This software depends on:
  - OCaml
  - Findlib
  - Compiler libs (only for 3.12)
  - GNU Make (install)

The following versions of OCaml are supported:
  - 3.12.1
  - 4.00.1
  - 4.01.0
  - 4.02.0 (grammar not fully implemented in pa_ocaml)

Remarks: 
  - OCaml version 3.12.1 does not come  with  the  compiler-libs.  They  are
    usually available as a separate package (ocaml-compiler-libs on Debian),
    but some interface files (.cmi) still need to be taken  from  the  OCaml
    source tree after compilation.

  - OCaml version 3.12.1 and 4.00.1 cannot bootstrap using  ascii  .ml  file
    (make boot), but it can bootstrap as a preprocessor. This does not prev-
    ent the use of these versions at all. This is due to the fact  that  the
    compiler-libs did not come with a pretty-printer for OCaml's ast back in
    the days, and we choose to boostrap using ascii  .ml  files  which  make
    everything easyer when it comes to debugging.

Installation procedure:
  tar -xvf decap.tar.gz
  cd decap
  make
  make
  sudo make install

Note: the first "make" command will compile pa_ocaml from ascii .ml files in
directory boostrap/X.XX.X (which were generated by pa_ocaml before distribu-
tion). The second "make" command will use the newly generated pa_ocaml bina-
ry as a preprocessor directly. It is safe to run make only once, but  it  is
not a bad idea to try and compile the files with the generated ocaml binary,
if only to be sure that everything is not broken...
