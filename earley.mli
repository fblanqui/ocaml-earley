(** {2 Types and exceptions} *)

(** Type of a parser (or grammar) producing a value of type ['a]. *)
type 'a grammar

(** As [Earley] does scannerless parsing, a notion of  [blank]  function
    is used to discard meaningless parts of the input (e.g. comments  or
    spaces). A [blank] function takes as input a [buffer] and a position
    (represented as an [int]) and returns a couple of a [buffer]  and  a
    position corresponding to the next meaningful character.

    WARNING: a blank function must return a normalized pair (b,p),
    which means 0 <= p < Input.line_num b. You can use Input.normalize
    to ensure this. *)
type blank = buffer -> int -> buffer * int

(** The exception [Parse_error(buf,pos,msgs)] is raised whenever parsing
    fails. It contains the position [pos] (and the corresponding  buffer
    [buf]) of the furthest reached position in the input. *)
exception Parse_error of buffer * int

(** [give_up ()] can be called by the user to force the parser to reject
    a possible parsing rule. *)
val give_up : unit -> 'a

(** [handle_exception fn v] applies the function [fn] to [v] and handles
    the [Parse_error] exception. In particular, a parse error message is
    presented to the user in  case  of  a  failure, then [error ()]
    is called. The default [error] is [fun () -> exit 1]. *)
val handle_exception : ?error:(unit -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b

(** {2 Atomic parsers} *)

(** [char ~name c v] is a grammar that accepts only the  character  [c],
    and returns [v] as a semantic value. An optional [name] can be given
    to the grammar for reference in error messages. *)
val char : ?name:string -> char -> 'a -> 'a grammar

(** [string s v] is a grammar that accepts only the  string  [str],  and
    returns [v] as a semantic value. An optional [name] can be given  to
    the grammar for reference in error messages. *)
val string : ?name:string -> string -> 'a -> 'a grammar

(** [keyword s forbidden v] is simalar to string, but the parsing fails
    if [forbidden c] returns [true] when [c] is the next available
    character. *)
val keyword : ?name:string -> string -> (char -> bool) -> 'a -> 'a grammar

(** [eof v] is a grammar that only accepts the end of file  and  returns
    [v] as a semantic value. Note that the end of file can be parsed one
    or more times (i.e. the input ends with infinitely many end of  file
    symbols. *)
val eof : 'a -> 'a grammar

(** [any] is a grammar that accepts a single character (but fails on the
    end of file) and returns its value. *)
val any : char grammar

(** [in_charset cs] is a grammar that parses any character of  the  [cs]
    charset, and returns its value. An optional [name] can be  given  to
    the grammar for reference in error messages. *)
val in_charset : ?name:string -> charset -> char grammar

(** [not_in_charset cs] is similar to  [in_charset cs]  but  it  accepts
    the characters that are not in [cs]. *)
val not_in_charset : ?name:string -> charset -> unit grammar

(** [blank_not_in_charset cs] is the same as [not_in_charset] but
    testing with blank_test. *)
val blank_not_in_charset : ?name:string -> charset -> unit grammar

(** [empty v] is a grammar that does not parse anything and returns  [v]
    as a semantic value. Note that this grammar never fails. *)
val empty : 'a -> 'a grammar

(** [fail ()] is a grammar that always fail, whatever the input. *)
val fail : unit -> 'a grammar

(** [black_box fn cs accept_empty name] is a grammar that uses the
    function [fn] to parses the input buffer. [fn buf pos] should
    start parsing [buf] at position [pos], and return a couple
    containing the new buffer and position of the first unread
    character. The character set [cs] must contain at least the
    characters that are accepted as first character by [fn], and no
    less. The boolean [accept_empty] must be true if the function
    accept the empty string. The [name] argument is used for reference
    in error messages. Note that the functon [fn] should use [give_up
    ()] in case of a parse error.

    WARNING: fn must return a triple (x,b,p) when (b,p) is normalized,
    which means 0 <= p < Input.line_num b. You can use Input.normalize to
    ensure this. *)
val  black_box : (buffer -> int -> 'a * buffer * int) -> charset -> bool
                   -> string -> 'a grammar

(** [debug msg] is a dummy grammar that always succeeds and prints [msg]
    on [stderr] when used. It is useful for debugging. *)
val debug : string -> unit grammar

(** [regexp ?name re] is a grammar that uses the regexp [re] to parse
    the input buffer. The value returnes is the array of the contents
    of the groups. *)
val regexp : ?name:string -> string -> string array grammar

(** {2 Blanks management} *)

(** [no_blank] is a [blank] function that does not discard any character
    of the input buffer. *)
val no_blank : blank

(** [blank_regexp re] builds a blank from the regexp [re]. *)
val blank_regexp : string -> blank

(** [blank_grammar gr bl] produces a [blank] function using the  grammar
    [gr] and the [blank] function [bl]. It parses as much of  the  input
    as possible using the grammar [gr] with the [blank]  function  [bl],
    and returns the reached position. *)
val blank_grammar : unit grammar -> blank -> blank

(** [change_layout ~old_blank_before  ~new_blank_after  gr bl]  replaces
    the current  [blank]  function with [bl],  while  parsing  using the
    grammar [gr].  The optional  parameter [old_blank_before] ([true] by
    default)  forces the application of the old blank  function,  before
    starting to parse with  [gr].  Note  that the new blank  function is
    always called before the first terminal of [gr]. Similarly, the opt-
    -ional parameter [new_blank_after] ([true] by default) forces a call
    to the new blank function after the end of the parsing of [gr]. Note
    that the old blank function is always called after the last terminal.
*)
val change_layout : ?old_blank_before:bool -> ?new_blank_after:bool
                      -> 'a grammar -> blank -> 'a grammar


(** [change_layout ~oba gr bl] same as abobe but with no blank.  It
    keeps the first char prediction and is therefore more efficient *)
val no_blank_layout : 'a grammar -> 'a grammar

(** {2 Support for recursive grammars} *)

(** [declare_grammar name] returns a new grammar that can be used in the
    definition of other grammars, but that cannot be run on input before
    it has been initialized with [set_grammar]. The [name]  argument  is
    used for reference to the grammar in error messages. *)
val declare_grammar : string -> 'a grammar

(** [set_grammar gr grdef] set the definiton of grammar [gr] (previously
    declared with [declare_grammar]) to be  [grdef].  [Invalid_argument]
    is raised if [set_grammar] is used on a grammar that was not created
    with [declare_grammar]. The behavious is undefined if a  grammar  is
    set twice with [set_grammar]. *)
val set_grammar : 'a grammar -> 'a grammar -> unit

(** {2 Parsing functions} *)

(** [parse_buffer gr bl buf] parses the buffer [buf] using  the  grammar
    [gr] and the blank function [bl]. The exception [Parse_error] may be
    raised in case of error. *)
val parse_buffer : 'a grammar -> blank -> buffer -> 'a

(** [parse_string ~filename gr bl str] parses the string [str] using the
    grammar [gr] and the blank function [bl]. An optional [filename] can
    be provided for reference  to  the  input  in  error  messages.  The
    exception [Parse_error] may be raised in case of error. *)
val parse_string : ?filename:string -> 'a grammar -> blank
                     -> string -> 'a

(** [parse_channel ~filename gr bl ch] parses the contenst of  the  input
    channel [ch] using the grammar [gr] and the blank  function  [bl].  A
    [filename] can be provided for reference to the input in case  of  an
    error. [parse_channel] may raise the [Parse_error] exception. *)
val parse_channel : ?filename:string -> 'a grammar -> blank
                      -> in_channel -> 'a

(** [parse_file gr bl fn] parses the file [fn] using the grammar [gr] and
    the blank function [bl]. The exception [Parse_error] may be raised in
    case of error. *)
val parse_file : 'a grammar -> blank -> string -> 'a

(** [partial_parse_buffer gr bl buf pos] parses  input  from  the  buffer
    [buf] starting a position [pos], using the grammar [gr] and the blank
    function [bl]. A triple is returned containing the  new  buffer,  the
    position that was reached during parsing, and the semantic result  of
    the parsing. The optional argument [blank_after], [true] by default,
    indicates if the returned position if after the final blank or not.
    Note that this function should not be used in the  defi-
    nition of a grammar using the [black_box] function. *)
val partial_parse_buffer : 'a grammar -> blank -> ?blank_after:bool ->
                            buffer -> int -> 'a * buffer * int

(** A functor providing support for using and [Input] preprocessor. *)
module WithPP : functor (PP : Preprocessor) ->
  sig
    (** [parse_string] is the same as [Earley.parse_string] but  it  uses
        the preprocessor defined by [PP]. *)

        preprocessor defined by [PP]. *)
    val parse_file : 'a grammar -> blank -> string -> 'a
  end

(** {2 Debuging and flags} *)

(** [debug_lvl] is a flag that can be set for [Earley] to display  debug
    data on [stderr]. The default value is [0], and bigger numbers acti-
    vate more and more debuging informations. *)
val debug_lvl : int ref

(** [warn_merge] is a flag that is used to choose whether  warnings  are
    displayed or not when an ambiguity is encountered while parsing. The
    default value is [true]. *)
val warn_merge : bool ref

(** [keep_all_names] is false by default and allow for inlining  grammar
    with a name to optimise parsing.  When debugging,  it is possible to
    set it to true  (before all grammar constructions) for more accurate
    messages. *)

val sequence : 'a grammar -> 'b grammar -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c grammar

(** [sequence_position g1 g2 f] is a grammar that first parses using [g1], and
    then parses using [g2]. The results of the sequence is then obtained by
    applying [f] to the results of [g1] and [g2], and to the positions (i.e.
    buffer and index) of the corresponding parsed input.

    Remark: [sequence g1 g2 f] is equivalent to

(** [sequence3] is similar to [sequence], but it composes three grammars into

    return its result. *)
val simple_dependent_sequence : 'a grammar -> ('a -> 'b grammar) -> 'b grammar

(** [dependent_sequence g1 g2] is a grammar that first parses using [g1],
