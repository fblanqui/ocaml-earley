   (** Type of an active element of the earley table.
       In a description of earley, an element is
       [(start, end, done * rest)] meaning we parsed
       the string from [pos1] to [pos2] with the rule [done]
       and it remains to parse [rest]. The '*' therefore denote
       the current position. Earley is basically a dynamic algorithm
       producing all possible elements.

       We depart from this representation in two ways:

       - we do not represent [done], we keep the whole whole rule:
         [full = done rest]

       - we never keep [end]. It is only used when we finish parsing of
         a rule and we have an element [(start, end, done * Empty)]
         then, we look for other element of the form
         [(start', end', done' * rest')] where
              * end' = start
              * rest' starts with a non terminal containing done
         We represent this situation by a stack in the element
         [(start, end, done * Empty)], that is maintained to lists
         all the elements satisfying the above property (no more,
         no less, each element only once)

         The type ['a final] represent an element of the earley table
         where [end] is the current position in the string being parsed.
    *)

    { start : pos2           (* position in the buffer, before and after blank *)
    ; stack : ('c, 'r) stack (* tree of stack of what should be do after

    } -> 'r final


   (** Type of the element that appears in stack. Note: all other
       elements will be collected by the GC, which is what we want to
       release memory.

       The type is similar to the previous: [('a, 'r) element], means
       that from a value of type 'a, comming from our parent in the stack,
       we could produce a value of type ['r] using [rest].

       The action needs to be prametrised by the future position which
       is unknown.

           } -> ('a,'r) element
     (* End of the stack *)
     | B : ('a -> 'r) pos -> ('a,'r) element

   (** stack themselves are in acyclic graph of elements (sharing is
       important to be preserved). We need a reference for the stack
       construction.
    *)
   and ('a,'b) stack = ('a,'b) element list ref

  (** For the construction of the stack, all elements of the
      same list ref of type ('a,'b) have the same [end'].
      And all elements that points to this stack have the
      [start = end']. Moreover, all elements with the
      same [full] and [start] must point to the same stack.
      Recall that [end] is not represented in elements.

      We call the position [end'] associated to a stack (as
      sait the [start] of the element point to this stack, the
      "stack position". An important point: stack are only
      constructed when the stack position is the current position.

      And if we omit the "right recursion optimisation", when
      we add a point from an element (start, end, rest, full)
      to a stack (which is therefore at position [start], we
      have [start = end] and [rest = full]. The rule has not
      parsed anything! The is the "prediction" phase of earley.

      To do this construction, we use the record below with
      a hook that we run on all elements added to that stack.
      This record is only used we stack whose position are the
      current position: all these records will become inaccessible
      when we advance in parsing.

      Morevoer, a direct pointer (thanks to the Container module)
      is kept from the [full] rule of all elements point to
      these stack and that have the current position as [end].
      This is the role of the functor call below.

      elements added to the stack later ! *)

(** Recal the INVARIANTS:

1Â° Consider two C elements (or two D elements) of a stack.  If their
   have the same start, rest and full is means we have parsed the same
   prefix of the rule from start to produce a value of the same type.

   Then, the two elements MUST HAVE PHYSICALLY EQUAL stack

2Â° For D nodes only, we keep only one for each (start, rest, full) triple
   so acts are necessarily physically equal
