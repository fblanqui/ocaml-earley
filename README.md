# Dependencies

 * OCaml (at least 4.03.0)
 * OCamlbuild
 * Findlib
 * Earley (https://github.com/rlepigre/ocaml-earley)
 * GNU Make

# Installation procedure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlepigre/ocaml-earley-ocaml.git
cd ocaml-earley-ocaml
make && make
sudo make install
```

**Note:** the first `make` command will compile `pa_ocaml` from an ascii OCaml
files in directory `boostrap/...` (generated by pa_ocaml before distribution).
The second `make` command will use the newly generated pa_ocaml binary as a
preprocessor directly. It is safe to run make only once, but it is not a bad
idea to try and compile the files with the generated ocaml binary, if only to
be sure that everything is not broken...
